Rapid City NodeSchool
====================

This repo contains work done by the Rapid City NodeSchool group in our journey to learn about nodejs.

### Reading

The interesting code (for our project) is all contained in the annotated file `serve.js`. Most of the other files are from the Refresh Rapid website repo, which we're borrowing to have something to serve ;)

### Running

Assuming you have [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [node](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed, you can install and run the server with the commands below:

```bash
# Download a local copy of the repositiory to ~/nodeschool
git clone https://github.com/clov3rly/nodeschool.git ~/nodeschool

# change to the project directory
cd ~/nodeschool

# Install local node package dependencies
npm install

# Run the server
node serve.js
```

Happy hacking!
